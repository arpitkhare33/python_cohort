# ======================== OPERATORS IN PYTHON =========================

# Arithmetic operators
# +,-,/,*
# % => modulus
# x = 7%4 # 7/4 => remainder value is given as the answer
# print(x)

# ** => exponentiation
# 2 to the power 3 => 8
# 3 to the power 2 => 9

# x = 4 ** 4
# print(x)


# // => floor division

# 1.5 => floor => 1
# res = 7//3
# print(res)























# Assignment Operators
# =, +=
# x = 5


# x += 5 => x= x+5 (shorthand operators)
# x -= 5 => x= x-5 (shorthand operators)
# x *= 5 => x= x*5 (shorthand operators)
# x /= 5 => x= x/5 (shorthand operators)
# x %= 5 => x= x%5 (shorthand operators)
# x //= 5 => x= x//5 (shorthand operators)
# x **= 5 => x= x**5 (shorthand operators)




# Comparison Operators

# ==
# <
# >
# >=
# <=
# !=
# x== y
# x == y
# 5<6 => False
# 6>=5 => True

# Logical Operators

# AND, OR, NOT
# AND => All inputs are true
# OR => If any one input is true
# NOT => Returns true, if the input is false
# false or true => true
# if 5>6 or 7>5:
#     print("The condition was true")
# if 5>6 and 7>5:
#     print("The conditon was true")


# if not 5>6:
#     print("The statement was true")



# Identity operators
# print(5 is 5)
# x = {"name": "arpit"}
# y = {"name": "arpit"}
# z = x
#
# # print(x is y)
# print(x is z)
# print(x is not y)



# Membership operators
# IN, NOT IN

my_list = ["apple", "boy", "orange"]
if "apple" not in my_list:
    print("It is a member")
else:
    print("It is not a member")


# BITWISE OPERATORS:
